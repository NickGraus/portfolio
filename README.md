# Portfolio - Nick Graus #
## Semester 2 Portfolio website ##

#### Description ####
In this repository I kepted record of my portfolio website of semester 2. All files required for the site can be found in this repo. While the html files are in main folder, the styling files an script files can be found inside sub-folders.

### Requirements ###
To run this website you need to have access to a browser. To make sure the site loads properly local, I would advise to use a live-server plugin on your IDE. I used Atom editor with live-server as my IDE.
- Atom: https://atom.io/
- Live-Server plugin: https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server

It is also possible to use another IDE and/or other plugins.


### How to use ###
1.  Make sure Atom and the live-server plugin ar ready to use.
2.  Download the repository and open it in Atom.
    - Open Atom
    - Go to: "File -> Add Project Folder".
    - Open the folder of the repository
    - Activate the live-server using the shortcut: crtl+alt+l or cmd+opt+l
 

I you followed these steps and open the website in a browser it should look like the website in the following link:
